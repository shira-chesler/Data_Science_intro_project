# Data_Science_intro_project
In this project we wanted to find the correlation between nutrition values of products and their price. Moreover, we Wanted to do a classification project based on how nutrition values can help us identify product's categry.
We started by doing web-scraping from the website of the grocery network 'Shufersal'. https://www.shufersal.co.il/online/he/A

we worked on both of the projects in jupyter notebooks, found intresting correlations and tried different models.

In the end, our best models were Random forest, in the classification the model got 71% accuracy and in the regression project the model has 3.16 MAE
