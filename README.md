# Data_Science_intro_project
In this project we want to find the correlation between nutrition values of products and their price.
We started by doing web-scraping from the website of the grocery network 'Shufersal'. https://www.shufersal.co.il/online/he/A

Afterward, we cleaned the dataset by making two different datasets`. One with only the 31 first features, which (according to a graph we made) are the ones that are most common within all the products. The second dataset was filtered by various methods (such as features that had less than 0.05 of the products in them, products that weren't measured by 100 grams or 1 kilogram, etcetera).
